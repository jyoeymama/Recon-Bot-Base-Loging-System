# Recon-Bot-Base-Loging-System
RBBLS is a way for my bot to log potential bases that logs the possible blocks to a txt file. This mod was originally made for version 1.21.4 Minecraft (fabric). To use this mod, simple drag the .jar file into your mods folder. Warning! You must have the fabric api installed and in your mods folder for this mod to operate! If you want to change some things about the mod like how fast it scans the area or the radius of the mod you can change it easily and set it to your desired radius. Comments will be below the things that show you where and how to change the settings of the mod. Please enjoy and feel free to email me at: jyomama28@gmail.com. If you like my work, consider dropping a follow and stay notified of when I make changes to my mods or any other repo that I own!
